INFO-H400 : a real-world eHealth project

In order to run the code, the database is provided. 
You may also need to download some of the dependencies such as activation.jar & javax.mail.jar.
You may download it here : https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.activation/activation/1.1.1 and http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/downloads/index.html

Our database contains real email address from students in our class and professors from the LISA department at the ULB.
So if you test the code and run it to register "patients" into the waiting list, you will send email to those "patients". 
Indeed, every feature of the application that requires to call Patients will send emails.
